# pwa-starter-vite-lit
PWA starter kit with vite/lit/ts/redux

## Goals
- A modern PWA starter kit
- Single-page application
- Fast builds with Vite
- State management with Redux, including routing
- Customizable to your own needs

## Quick start
Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```
Start the dev server and open browser
```sh
yarn start
```

## Scripts
- `dev` - start dev server
- `start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build (don't use for production)
- `serve` - serve the production build (use for production)

## Visual Studio Code
There is a `Run & Debug (F5)` config available that starts the dev server and opens a debug chrome window, with locally persisted user profile in the .vscode directory (in case you want to keep extensions across sessions, such as Redux DevTools)

## Inspiration
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
